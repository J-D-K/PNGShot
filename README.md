# PNGShot
A sysmodule I wrote, _and thought I lost_, in 2020 that captures screenshots as PNG's instead of JPEGs. Besides updating code for the current libnx, this is completely untested and only builds _as far as I know_. Use at your own risk, but there's nothing here that can cause _permanent_ damage...

## Building
Requires:
* devkitpro
* switch-libpng
* switch-zlib
